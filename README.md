<h1>Description:</h1>
Developed an application to visualize graph algorithms and demonstrate their practical applications in constructing road maps. Leveraged advanced knowledge in data structures, graph theory, and the Qt framework to create a user-friendly interface for visualizing various algorithms both dynamically and statically.

Technologies Used: C++, Qt Framework

Algorithms Implemented: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Primâ€™s Minimum Spanning Tree, Dijkstra's Shortest Path
<h1>Key Responsibilities:</h1>
Designed and implemented core functionalities using data structures and graph algorithms.

Developed an intuitive GUI with Qt to facilitate both dynamic and static visualization of graph algorithms.

Ensured efficient performance and accuracy in algorithm implementation.

Conducted thorough testing and debugging to maintain high-quality standards.

This project highlights my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems, enhance user experience through effective UI design, and optimize algorithm performance.
